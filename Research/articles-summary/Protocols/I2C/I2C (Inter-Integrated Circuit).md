# I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

## What it is
I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a **synchronous serial communication protocol** designed for communication between **multiple devices on the same bus** using only **two wires**.

It is widely used for:
- Sensors
- RTCs
- EEPROMs
- Configuration and control devices

I2C prioritizes **simplicity and scalability** over speed.

---

## How it works
I2C uses a **master–slave (controller–target)** architecture:
- One or more **masters** can exist
- Multiple **slaves** share the same bus

All devices connect to the same two lines:
- One clock line
- One data line

Each slave has a **unique address**.  
The master selects a device by sending its address before data transfer.

Only one device talks at a time.

## Signals & timing
I2C uses **two signals**:

- **SCL (Serial Clock Line)** – clock generated by the master
- **SDA (Serial Data Line)** – bidirectional data line

### Important timing details
- Data changes only when the clock is LOW
- Data is read when the clock is HIGH
- Communication starts with a **START condition**
- Communication ends with a **STOP condition**
- Devices acknowledge bytes using an **ACK/NACK bit**

### Pull-up resistors
- SDA and SCL are **open-drain**
- External pull-up resistors are required
- Logic HIGH is achieved by releasing the line

---

## Pros / Cons

###  Pros
- Only two wires regardless of number of devices
- Built-in addressing
- Widely supported
- Ideal for low-speed peripherals
- Easy to expand (just add devices)

###  Cons
- Slower than SPI
- Requires pull-up resistors
- More complex protocol
- Shared bus can become congested
- Limited cable length and speed

## When to use it
Use I2C when:
- You have **many low-speed peripherals**
- Pin count is limited
- Devices are on the same PCB
- You need built-in addressing
- Configuration/control data is more important than speed

---

## Simple example
**Microcontroller reading a temperature sensor**:
1. Master sends a START condition
2. Master sends the sensor’s address + read bit
3. Sensor acknowledges (ACK)
4. Sensor sends temperature data
5. Master sends STOP condition

Multiple sensors can share the same two wires.

---

## Common mistakes
- Forgetting pull-up resistors
- Address conflicts between devices
- Using incorrect address format (7-bit vs 8-bit confusion)
- Assuming long cable lengths will work
- Running the bus too fast for the devices

---

## Analogy
Think of I2C like a **group chat**:
- Everyone shares the same channel
- Each person has a unique username (address)
- Only one person talks at a time
- Messages are acknowledged
- Efficient for coordination, not fast conversations
